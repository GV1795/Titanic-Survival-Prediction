# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The Titanic Survival Prediction Project
is a classic machine learning problem where the goal is to develop a model
that can predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more.
The dataset includes information about passengers such as their name, age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived or not. 
The goal is to train a machine learning model on a subset of this data and use it to predict the survival of passengers in another subset Code.
The model used for this project is a machine learning model  Logistic Regression. The model is trained on a training subset of the Titanic dataset and evaluated on a separate validation subset.
The results of the model evaluation, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, are printed to the console.
